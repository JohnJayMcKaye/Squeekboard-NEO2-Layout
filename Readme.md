# This is the first Neo2- Keyboard-Layout file for Pinephone
This works on every Phosh Desktop Linux Distro, just:

Copy this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnJayMcKaye/Squeekboard-NEO2-Layout/main/de%2Bneo.yaml) into ~/.local/share/squeekboard/keyboards/de+neo.yaml
And don`t forgett to set the neo2 Keyboardlayout in Settings. 

==and maybe reboot==
